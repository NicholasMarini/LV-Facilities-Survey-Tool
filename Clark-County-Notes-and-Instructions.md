## About the Clark County Facilities Survey Tool

<div id="about-the-Clark-County-Facilities-Tool-2">


</div>

  - ***Overall Goal*** : There are two primary goals of the Clark County Facilities Survey Tool. The first is to make it easier to identify the areas of the county with the highest levels of need for high-quality seats. These identified areas are where charter operators should target the opening of their new schools. The second is to provide charter operators with an actionable list of facility options to expedite their facilities search along with their creation of new high-quality schools. This tool achieves these goals through user inputs which -
      - Highlights regional need within a map and a table of aggregated school information
      - Highlights school level need within a map 
      - Presents nearby viable facility options within a map and a customized table  
      
        
 - ***Background*** : As of the creation of this tool, total student enrollment in Clark County exceeds the number of seats available in public schools and over 1/3 of students are enrolled in schools performing below the state average. The persistent overcrowding and underperformance of schools across Clark County presents a valuable opportunity for charter operators to open high-quality schools where it matters most.

## Metric Calculations and Assumptions

<div id="demand-score">


</div>

  - ***Need Score*** :  indicates the need for high-quality school seats based on the following three factors -
    
      - *School Quality* :  
        Is based on a [one-to-five star rating        system](https://doe.nv.gov/News__Media/Press_Releases/2019/2019_Nevada_Schools_Performance_Framework_Features_184_Schools_With_Increased_Star_Ratings/) which indicates school performance relative to Nevada state standards. A one-star rating indicates that a school *did not meet* state performance standards while a five-star rating indicates that a school *exceeded* state performance standards. The School Quality factor prioritizes lower-quality schools (low star ratings) as an indicator of need for higher quality seats.
    
      - *Utilization* :  
      Is the total regional enrollment divided by the overall regional seat capacity. Regions with Utilization       rates that exceed 100% are considered over-utilized. The Utilization factor prioritizes higher                utilization rates, as they indicate regions where school seat capacity is insufficient to support the         current student population.  
        
        Capacity for projected future years is based on the 2019-20 school year, as it is the most recent school       capacity study available.  
          
          There are over 2,000 portable classrooms in Clark County. These portable classrooms are not considered a       long term capacity solution and have been excluded from school capacity calculations. 


    
      - *Surplus Enrollment* :  
        Is the difference between school capacity and enrollment. The Surplus Enrollment factor prioritizes           greater numbers of Surplus Enrollment as it is an indicator of the potential enrollment for any new           high-quality seats to be created. 
        
        Like Utilization, the calculation for Surplus Enrollment also excludes school capacity for portable           classrooms.

<div id="1">



</div>

Enrollment projections, which generate projected Utilization and Surplus
Enrollment, are calculated using a rolling weighted enrollment average
from the most recent five years prior to the selected enrollment year
(or the Select a Year to Open Your School field). Enrollment for years
closer to the enrollment year selected are more heavily weighted.

<div id="2">


</div>

The need Score is the sum of the weighted School Quality, Utilization
and Surplus Enrollment need factors. The weights of these factors
prioritize School Quality and are as follows -

  - School Quality = 60%
  - Utilization = 20%
  - Surplus Enrollment = 20%

</div>

<div id="demand-score-formula-formula">


<h6>

Demand Score = (School Quality x 60%) + (Utilization x 20%) + (Surplus
Enrollment x 20%)

</h6>

</div>

<div id="supply-score">


</div>

  - ***Supply Score*** : indicates the need for high-quality school
    seats based on the following three factors
      - Cost: Prioritizes facilities with the lowest cost
      - Size: Prioritizes facilities with the greatest amount of space
      - Distance: Prioritizes facilities closest to the Priority School
        selected

## Instructions

<div id="instructions-2">

</div>

Use the instructions below to navigate the 'Find a Region' and 'Find a Facility' tabs to first identify high-need regions of Clark County and then review potentially viable facilities based on your search criteria.

  - **Find a Region For Your School** Tab - identify the areas of highest need
    
    - The find a region tab has three primary components:
      
      - Drop down menus at the top to customize the calculation for regional need
      
      - Map that displays regional need color coded for degree of need by zip code
      
      - Regional need table with more details on need factors
    
    - Make selections about the school you plan to open from the drop down menus at the top of the screen

      - Select your opening school year

      - Select your School Level (the intended school level to serve-- ES, MS, HS)

      - If the school you plan to open will serve more than one grade level, review regional need for each grade level by toggling the drop down for each (e.g if you plan to open a K-8 review regional need for ES and MS and identify zip codes where need overlaps)

    - Review the regional need map to identify the zip code with the highest need

      - The regions with higher need are shaded darker

      - Click on the zip code region to see a tooltip with more information including: zip code, regional need score, regional quality, average building utilization, surplus enrollment, portables, and demographic information
      
      - Review the regional need table to see a list of zip codes with additional information sorted by regional need score.  
      
      - For best functionality of the Find a Region map use of Firefox or Google Chrome browser is recommended  
      

  - **Find a Facility** Tab - Use the 'Find a Facility' tab to view available facilities in the map and table
    
    - The find a facility tab has three primary components:

      - Map with facilities (orange squares) and schools (blue circles) to explore the available facilities in Clark County

      - Left side bar with drop down menus to select your preferences

      - Table with all facilities listed

    - Review the map to explore the available facilities in the area and nearby schools.

      - Facilities are the orange squares. The facilities with the highest supply score will be marked with a number (1-10) indicating their supply score rank. By clicking on a facility you can see a tooltip with additional information about the facility including: address, zip code, cost, and size.

      - Schools are the circles on the map. 

            **Selected Schools:**  The blue/green shaded circles are the selected schools based on the school level (ES, MS, HS) you selected on the 'Find a Region Tab' and the Region selected in drop down to the left of the map. The circles are shaded according to school need score, darker blue circles have higher need scores and lighter green circles have lower need scores. By clicking on a school you can see a tooltip with additional information about the school including the: name, zip code, senate district, and assembly district.
          
            **Other Schools:**  The grey circles in the map are all of the other schools in Clark County. These are the schools that are a different level than your selection (ES, MS, HS) and / or outside of the region you selected in the drop down menu to the left of the map. Using the 'Other schools' checkbox in the upper right corner you can elect to include or exclude these schools on the map. By clicking on a school you can see a tooltip with additional information about the school including the: name, zip code, senate district, and assembly district, note that need score is not calculated for these schools.

    - In the top right corner of the map are checkboxes. By selecting the check boxes you can see additional geographic information through overlays.
  
        **Zip Code:** Select the zip code check box to see an overlay of the zip code boundaries in Clark County.
      
        **Opportunity Zones:** Select the opportunity zone check box to overlay shaded opportunity zones.
        
        **Other Schools:** Select the other schools check box to include all schools (as grey circles) in Clark County on the map.
       
    - Select your preferences using the drop downs in the left sidebar.
  
      - Region or Zip Code: Type in a zip code based on the high need regions you identified in the 'Find a Region' tab and select a region that includes that zip code. Regions are high school attendance zones and cover a larger range than zip codes.
  
      - Priority School: Using the map identify the schools with the highest school-need scores (these will be the darker shaded circle markers) and select a high-need school in the region you selected as the priority school.
  
      - Search Factors: Use search factors to customize the facility supply score based on what is most important to you.
        
              *Lower cost* - select how important cost is to you. The more important you indicate, the more weight will be given to cost and lower cost facilities will receive a higher supply score.
    
              *Larger size* - select how important size is to you. The more important you indicate, the more weight will be given to size and larger facilities will receive a higher supply score.
    
              *Shorter distance from Priority School* - select how important proximity to the priority school is to you. The more important you indicate, the more weight will be given to location (distance from priority school) and closer will receive a higher supply score.

      - Review and scroll through the Facilities Table, this table provides additional context and actionable contact information on the facilities displayed in the map above.

- **Add New Facilities** tab

     - If new viable facilities surface (e.g. temporary incubation spaces like churches, non-profit or municipal facilities) which users would like to include in the tool for future searches, complete all fields in the Add New Facilities tab. Be sure that all fields are entered into the appropriate syntax and exclude extraneous characters. 
  
     - To find longitude and latitude, copy and paste the full address into [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps). Once the location populates onto the screen, right click the red pin and select "What's Here?" A pop-up will prompt the longitude and latitude at the bottom. Copy and paste these coordinates into their appropriate fields.
  
     - Once all fields are complete, click the "Submit" button which will add the new facility to the tool. Reload the page (or the tool) to incorporate the new facility into a new search.

- **Additional Resources** tab

      - Access links to additional information and outside resources using the additional resources tab. This tab includes links to the following: political resources, financial resources, O180 resources, and facility partner websites.
